Machine Learning Algorithms Implemented From Scratch
1. Introduction

The objective of this project is to design and implement a custom machine learning library by developing multiple machine learning algorithms entirely from scratch, without using any high-level machine learning frameworks such as Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch. Only fundamental numerical and data-handling libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib were used.

The project focuses on understanding the internal working principles of machine learning algorithms, including optimization, loss functions, gradient descent, and data preprocessing techniques. Each model was trained using provided training datasets and evaluated using separate test datasets to validate correctness and generalization performance.

2. Libraries and Tools Used

The following libraries were used as permitted:

NumPy – Numerical computations, matrix operations, and optimization

Pandas – Data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing

Matplotlib – Visualization of loss curves and predictions

Google Colab – Development and execution environment

No external machine learning libraries were used.

3. Dataset Description

Multiple datasets were provided, each corresponding to a different learning task:

Dataset	Task Type
linear_train.csv, linear_test.csv	Linear Regression
poly_train.csv, poly_test.csv	Polynomial Regression
binary_train.csv, binary_test.csv	Binary Classification
multiclass_train.csv, multiclass_test.csv	Multiclass Classification (Neural Network)

Each dataset was split into:

Training set – used exclusively for learning model parameters

Test set – used only for final evaluation and submission

4. Data Preprocessing
4.1 Handling Missing Values

Rows containing missing target labels were removed, as supervised learning models require valid labels.

4.2 Feature Normalization

Feature normalization was implemented manually to improve convergence during training.
Normalization parameters (mean and standard deviation) were computed only on training data and reused for test data to prevent data leakage.

This ensured fair and unbiased evaluation.

4.3 Label Encoding

For multiclass classification:

Labels were encoded into integers

One-hot encoding was applied using NumPy

5. Algorithms Implemented
5.1 Linear Regression

Mean Squared Error (MSE) used as the loss function

Model parameters updated iteratively to minimize loss

Evaluation Metric: Mean Squared Error (MSE)

5.2 Polynomial Regression

Polynomial feature expansion implemented manually

Normalization applied after feature expansion

Gradient descent used for optimization

Evaluation Metric: Mean Squared Error (MSE)

5.3 Logistic Regression (Binary Classification)

Sigmoid activation function implemented

Binary Cross-Entropy loss used

Gradient descent optimization

Evaluation Metric: Accuracy

5.4 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Distance-based classification using Euclidean distance

No training phase (lazy learning)

Majority voting for prediction

Evaluation Metric: Accuracy

5.5 K-Means Clustering

Random centroid initialization

Iterative centroid updates until convergence

Unsupervised learning approach

5.6 Decision Tree

Implemented using entropy and information gain

Recursive splitting of nodes

Manual stopping conditions applied

5.7 Neural Network (Multiclass Classification)

A fully connected N-layer Neural Network was implemented from scratch with:

Forward propagation

Backpropagation

Weight initialization (Xavier / He)

Optimizers:

Momentum

RMSProp

Adam

Activation functions: ReLU, Softmax

One-hot encoded targets

Evaluation Metric: Accuracy

6. Training and Evaluation Strategy

Models were trained only on training datasets

Test datasets were never used during training or hyperparameter tuning

Preprocessing steps were consistent across training and test data

Performance was evaluated using appropriate metrics for each task

This ensured a fair and unbiased evaluation of model generalization.

7. Results
Model	Metric	Test Performance

(Exact values depend on dataset and training parameters.)

8. Submission Files

For each dataset, predictions were saved in CSV format:

linear_submission.csv

binary_submission.csv

poly_submission.csv

multiclass_submission.csv

Each submission file contains:

id, prediction

9. Challenges Faced

Handling normalization consistently across train and test datasets

Managing polynomial feature dimensionality

Preventing data leakage

Debugging broadcasting and shape mismatch errors

Implementing backpropagation and optimizers from scratch

All challenges were resolved through systematic debugging and validation.

10. Conclusion

This project provided deep insight into the internal workings of machine learning algorithms. Implementing models from scratch strengthened understanding of optimization, loss functions, gradient descent, and data preprocessing. The models were successfully trained and evaluated using only foundational libraries, demonstrating correctness and robustness.
